With the wisdom of Telegrinder and the arcane might of SQLAlchemy, this sacred tome shall guide thee in creating bots that bend the digital realms to thy will._

## 🧙 **The Sacred Powers Contained Within**

_Step boldly, for here you shall find the tools of bot-crafting beyond your wildest imaginings:_

- **Telegrinder Framework: The Lightning Blade** ⚡️
  A swift and deadly framework, Telegrinder gives you the power to wield Telegram bots as effortlessly as a sword in the hands of a master swordsman. It cuts through the complexity of bot creation with a single stroke.

- **SQLAlchemy: The Philosopher's Stone of Data** 🏺
  Transform mere data into golden interactions with SQLAlchemy, the ORM that binds the material realm of databases to the ethereal workings of your bot. With it, your bot shall command its own data with divine precision.

- **Pre-configured Migrations: The Scroll of Evolution** 📜
  Fear not the chaos of changing tables and schemas! Migrations have been set in place by the ancients, ensuring that your bot may evolve and adapt without risking the collapse of your sacred database structures.

- **PostgreSQL Support: The Rising Titan (Coming Soon)** 🏛️
  Soon, the legendary PostgreSQL shall rise from the depths, a towering behemoth of scalability, bringing with it the power to handle vast legions of data with ease.

- **Docker Integration: The Eternal Vessel (Coming Soon)** 🐳
  What is a bot without a vessel to contain it? Docker shall soon arrive, an enchanted ship to carry your bot across seas of servers and lands of environments, so it may live forevermore, no matter the terrain!

## ⚔️ **Ritual of Summoning: How to Awaken Thy Bot**

Heed these words well, for to summon a bot of true power, one must perform the sacred rites with care:

### 1. **Clone the Ancient Repository**
   First, enter the repository’s sanctum with the following incantation:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prostomarkeloff/telegrinder-alchemy
   cd telegrinder-alchemy
   ```

### 2. **Forge the Circle of Protection (Virtual Environment)**
   To protect your project from dependency demons, invoke the virtual environment spell:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```

### 3. **Summon the Bard of Dependencies (Poetry)**
   Now call forth Poetry, the bard who sings the song of dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

### 4. **Inscribe the Spells (Install Dependencies)**
   Speak the words to complete the installation of your bot’s mystical requirements:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### 5. **Prepare the Scroll of Secrets (.bot-env)**
   Inscribe your scroll with the secret knowledge required to bind your bot to the realms of Telegram:
   ```
   DB_URL=your_database_url_here
   BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_api_key_here
   ```

### 6. **Awaken the Beast (Run the Bot)**
   At last, utter the final invocation to breathe life into your bot:
   ```bash
   python bot
   ```

_And lo! The bot shall spring to life, ready to heed your commands, and to journey forth into the wide world of Telegram._

## 🌌 **The Path Ahead: What Lies Beyond the Horizon**

Though your bot is powerful, even greater magics are yet to be revealed. Brave coder, the future holds vast potential:

   Soon you shall wield PostgreSQL, a database of immense strength, capable of handling kingdoms of data without faltering. With it, your bot shall stand unshaken, no matter how vast its empire of users grows.

- **Docker: The Spell of Immortality** 💀⚡
   Docker shall grant your bot the power to transcend its earthly limitations, placing it within a container—a perfect vessel that allows it to exist anywhere and everywhere. With Docker, your bot shall never perish, no matter what land it sails to.

- **More Spells from Telegrinder’s Grimoire** 🧙‍♂️
   As the repository grows, new spells shall be written into the tome, granting you ever-greater control over the Telegram realms. Prepare yourself for even more advanced bot capabilities that will empower you to perform feats of coding sorcery.
